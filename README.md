# Project title


## Summary
This repository is built using html/css, Javascript, Webpack and babel7, using SPA (React), SPA Routing and REST api.
Note that there has been no tests done, therefore the ./tests folder will be empty.

The focus of this application is to show all the techniques i've learned through class and show my understanding towards them.
Additionally i've utilized bootstrap's css to show my understanding of stylization, however i'm aware the course is not frontend focused.

To get started start from the root folder and perform:

## Setup Instructions:

Starting from the root directory

### `npm install`

### `npm run dev`

npm run dev will create a **bundle.js** file at the ./public folder
and starts a **single NodeJS instance serving both the frontend and backend** , at server port 8080.
The application will also reload using nodemon everytime a change has been made.

Small parts of this code has been used to achieve the functions: (github link if theres any)
